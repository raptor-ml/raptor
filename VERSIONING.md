# Versioning and Releasing for Raptor

We (mostly) follow the [common Kubebuilder versioning guidelines][guidelines], and use the corresponding tooling and PR
process described there.

[guidelines]: https://sigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder-release-tools/VERSIONING.md

## Compatibility

Note that we generally do not support older release branches, except in extreme circumstances.
